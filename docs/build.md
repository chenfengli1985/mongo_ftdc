You will need  a recent version of Boost (1.75+) to build **pyftdc**.  
Also, Python3 and Python 3 developent libraries


For Ubuntu:
``` 
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip
sudo apt-get install -y cmake libboost-all-dev libboost-log-dev libboost-log-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev 
```

For Centos8
```
sudo yum install -y python3 python3-devel
sudo apt-get install  libboost-all-devel libboost-log-devel libboost-log-devel libboost-program-options-devel libboost-regex-devel
```


**NOTE**

Older versions of Boost will not work. If not available as a package, you will need to install it manually
